# AVL-Trees
Simple trees and AVL implemented using C++ 

Also there are string specific functions in ``tree.hpp`` check them out too. These function only work if tree called using 
``tree<std::string, any>``.

## **Run the code**

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/c0rRupT9/AVL-Trees.git
  && cd AVL-Trees/src
```
To compile the code
```bash
C++ main.cpp -o trees.exe
```
To run enter
```bash
trees
```
or for PS

```bash
./trees
```
I will soon add parameters for understanding.
